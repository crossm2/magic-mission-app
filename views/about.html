For people focused on time, it’s the amount of time exercising that’s important. When I workout, my focus is to workout 20-30 minutes, so I need a list of exercises to get me to that goal. This app acts as an ingredient list without the measurements. We supply the exercises and users decide the amount and intensity.</p> </div> <!--card--> <div class="about-card"> <h5><img src="images/marlie.b31f7830.png" height="100" width="100">Marlie's Philosophy</h5> <p>My goal is always to perform a workout as safely and efficiently as possible. We aim to provide suggested timelines and equipment that can be adjusted based on your personal fitness level and schedule. My motto is: form before speed and range of motion before intensity. Remember to save time to warm-up and cool down before and after each exercise!</p> </div> </div> <br> <!--Make mission magic--> <h4>Make Mission Magic</h4> <div class="about-card-container"> <!--card--> <div class="about-card"> <h5>Starting It</h5> <p>Imagine this app as a box of notecards. Each Circuit has 10 exercises, so when you go to the gym, you can pick a "notecard" and have a great workout.Start with the first exercise and work through the circuit in order. Each exercise will show the # of cycles of complete for each circuit.</p> </div> <!--card--> <div class="about-card"> <h5>Cusomizing It</h5> <p>It's customizable, so you can skip exercises you don't like and the app will suggest a new one instead. Each exercise has instructions so you can learn proper form. Want to bring up the intensity? Work on increasing your speed by timing how long it takes to complete one circuit, push to beat your time each round.</p> </div> </div> </div>
